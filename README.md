# filename-operations README

A Visual Studio Code extension called "filename-operations". This extension is a work-in-progress.

## Features

Makes use of some of Change-Case package to change cases of filenames. Operations can be done on one to many files making it easy to switch between cases and retaining filename conventions.

As mentioned, this is a WIP so only right click menu actions work. The same Commands from the Command Pallet don't currently work.
